# Security Notes (Demo)

This demo intentionally excludes:
- Proprietary feature engineering and signal conditioning
- Production model architectures/weights
- Personalization layers and thresholds
- Data quality guards, anomaly handling, and alert policies
- Any direct integrations or credentials

All outputs are simplified. For licensing evaluation, we can enable a secure, timeâ€‘limited API on our side.
